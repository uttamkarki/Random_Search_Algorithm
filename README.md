# Random Search Algorithm

The Random Search Algorithm is a fundamental optimization technique that explores solution spaces by generating random candidate solutions. While simplistic, it serves as a valuable approach for finding feasible solutions to optimization problems, particularly in scenarios where complex algorithms may be unnecessary or impractical.

## Features

- **Stochastic Exploration:** Randomly generates solutions, offering a diverse and unbiased search process.
- **Simplicity:** Minimal implementation complexity makes it easy to integrate and apply in various domains.
- **Quick Evaluation:** Rapid evaluation of randomly sampled solutions, suitable for high-dimensional or complex problems.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Serves as a baseline for assessing the performance of more advanced optimization methods.
- **Low Resource Demand:** Requires fewer computational resources, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

## Usage

1. **Define Objective:** Formulate an optimization problem with a well-defined objective function.

2. **Configure Parameters:** Set the number of random samples to generate and evaluate.

3. **Implement Random Search:** Utilize the provided example code or integrate the algorithm into your project.

4. **Sample Solutions:** Generate random candidate solutions within the solution space.
